\section*{Question 4}
Disprove:\\
There exists an integer \textit{m} $\ge$ 3 so $m^3-1$ is prime.\\\\
\textbf{Formal restatement}\\
Let the predicate be Q(x) evaluate true if x is prime.
$\exists m \in \{a | a \ge 3\}, Q(x)$
\begin{proof}
  \begin{addmargin}{1em}
    Let the predicate be Q(x) evaluate true if x is prime.\\
    Let the predicate C(x) evaluate true if x is composite.\\
    In this proof I will disprove $\exists m \in \{a | a \ge 3\}, Q(x)$ by proving its negation:\\
    $\forall m \in \{a | a \ge 3\}, C(m)$\\
    m can be only even or odd. I will now proceed by cases. \\
    \subsection*{Case 1 - odd}
    \begin{addmargin}{1em}
      If x is odd, $m^3-1$ will result in an even number. Even numbers above 2 are divisible by 2 and another number, and as such are all composite.\\
    \end{addmargin}
    \subsection*{Case 2 - even}
    \begin{addmargin}{1em}
      If m is even, $m^3-1$ will always be divisible by $(m-1)$. \\
      As $1(m-1) \neq (m^3-1)$ for m $\ge$ 3, there is always another factor greater than 1, making $(m^3-1)$ composite.\\\\
    \end{addmargin}
    As this accounts for every possibility of m, the negation of $\exists m \in \{a | a \ge 3\}, Q(m)$ is true in every case, meaning that the original statement is false in every case. This statement is invalid. This concludes the proof.
  \end{addmargin}
\end{proof}

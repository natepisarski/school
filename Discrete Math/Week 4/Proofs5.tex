\section*{Assignment - Question 5}
Prove:\\
The difference of the squares of any two consecutive integers is odd.\\
\textbf{Formal Restatement:}\\
Let Q(x) evaluate to true if $(x+1)^2 - x^2$ is odd.\\
$x \in \mathbb{Z}, Q(x)$\\
\begin{proof}
  \begin{addmargin}{1em}
    Consider that given any two consecutive integers, one will always be even and one will always be odd.\\
    Considering the definition of even and odd numbers, $(x+1)^2 - x^2$ is equivalent to:\\
    \indent $(2k+1)^2 - 4k^2$, where k is an integer.\\
    Expanded, this statement reads $4k^2+4k+1-4k^2$.\\
    This statement is equivalent to 2(2k)+1.\\
    As the product of 2 and any integer plus 1 is odd, and the multiplication of two integers (2 and k) is an integer, this form shows that $(x+1)^2-x^2$ is always odd.\\
  \end{addmargin}
  The argument is valid. This concludes the proof.
\end{proof}

\section*{Assignment - Question 8}
Prove:\\
The sum of any five consecutive integers is divisible by 5.\\
\textbf{Formal Restatement:}
$\forall x \in \mathbb{Z}, (x+(x+1)+(x+2)+(x+3)+(x+4))|5$
\begin{proof}
  \begin{addmargin}{1em}
  Consider that consecutive integers proceeding x are defined by their position from x.\\
  Thus, the statement $(x+(x+1)+(x+2)+(x+3)+(x+4))$ describes any 5 consecutive integers.\\\\
  This statement simplifies into $5x+10$.\\
  As this generic expression describes any 5 consecutive integers, the form $5x+10$ will always be the result.\\
  As 5|5 and 10|5, the resulting integer is divisible by 5 in every case.\\
  This argument is valid.
  \end{addmargin}
  \textbf{done}
\end{proof}

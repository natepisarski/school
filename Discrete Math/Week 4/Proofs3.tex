Prove: \\
The sum of any two odd numbers is even.\\\\
\textbf{Statement}\\
In those proof, I will prove that the sum of any two odd numbers is even.\\\\
Formal restatement:\\
Let \textit{O} represent the set $\{2x+1 | x \in \mathbb{Z}\}$\\
Let \textit{E} represent the set $\{2x | x \in \mathbb{Z}\}$\\
$\forall x,y \in D, x+y \in E$
\begin{proof}
  \begin{addmargin}{1em}
  Consider that the definitions of even and odd are as follow:\\
  \begin{addmargin}{1em}
    A number is even if it is equivelant to 2 multiplied with any integer.\\
    A number is odd if it is equialent to 1 plus the product of 2 and any integer.\\
  \end{addmargin}
  Let k be any value such that $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.\\
  Let l be any value such that $l \in \mathbb{Z}$.\\
  (2k+1)+(2l+1) represents the addition of any 2 odd numbers.\\\\
  This is equivalent to $4k+2+4l+2$.\\
  $4k+2+4l+2$ is equivalent to $2(2k+1+2l+1)$.\\
  $2k+1+2l+1$ is an integer, so this expression is 2 multiplied with an integer.\\
  This satisfies the conditions of being an even number. The argument is valid.\\
  
  \end{addmargin}
  This completes the proof.
\end{proof}

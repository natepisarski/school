# school
Hello and welcome! This is my school repository. I'm going to be putting completed assignments here as both future reference for myself when I revisit some of these topics, as well as to (hopefully) help to serve as a reference for other people doing something similar.

I am going to be putting most, if not all, of my assignments I do into this repo AFTER grading. This is for a few reasons:

* They won't ding a plagiarism detector.
* Classmates, if they know about this repository, can't copy or "get inspiration" from my work
* Errors can be corrected

# Using these documents
But yeah. You can use any of these documents in your work. Please, for the sake of not making a dingus out of yourself, find a way to try and cite these documents. The author for **all** documents is Nathaniel Pisarski. That and the commit date should help you build your cite. Use it in whatever you like. This is work I don't need anymore.

Of course, if you're looking at something like one of my LaTeX documents then by all means, take code samples from them without a citation. Just don't take **content**
